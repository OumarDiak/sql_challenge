This project involves three key components: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

1. Data Modeling

Inspect the CSV files to understand the structure and relationships between the data.
Use a tool like QuickDBD to sketch an ERD that represents the tables and their relationships.

3. Data Engineering

Define the table schema for each of the six CSV files.
Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Ensure primary keys are unique, and if not, create composite keys.
Create tables in the correct order to handle foreign key dependencies.
Import data from the CSV files into the corresponding SQL tables.

3. Data Analysis

List employee details such as employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
Identify employees hired in 1986, including their first name, last name, and hire date.
List department managers with details about their department.
Match employees to their department numbers, and include their department names.
Find employees with the first name "Hercules" and last name starting with "B".
List employees in the Sales department.
List employees in the Sales and Development departments.
Count and display the frequency of all last names in descending order.

Key Deliverables:

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or table schemas for all tables.
SQL table schemas with correct data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
SQL queries that produce the specified data analysis outputs.

This project requires a combination of database design, SQL schema creation, data importation, and executing data analysis queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
